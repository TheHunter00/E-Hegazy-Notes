| Feature                     | IPv4                                      | IPv6                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Bits**          | 32 bits                                   | 128 bits                                  |
| **Notation**                | Four decimal octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1)  | Eight hexadecimal groups (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) |
| **Prefix Notation**         | CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)     | CIDR notation (e.g., 2001:0db8::/64)      |
| **Address Space**           | Approximately 4.3 billion addresses      | Approximately 340 undecillion addresses    |
| **Address Allocation**       | Often requires manual allocation          | Supports automatic allocation via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) |
| **Security**                | Requires additional protocols for security | Built-in security features like IPsec      |
| **Complexity**              | Less complex to manage                   | More complex due to additional features   |
| **Configuration**           | Typically requires manual setup           | Greater support for automatic configuration |
| **Network Compatibility**    | Requires NAT for connecting different networks | Supports dual stack for backward compatibility |
| **Network Segmentation**    | Depends on traditional subnetting         | Allows better segmentation using prefixes   |
| **Routing Efficiency**      | Less efficient routing                    | Improved routing efficiency and network performance |
