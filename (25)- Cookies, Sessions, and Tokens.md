| **Definition**      | Small pieces of data stored on the user's device by the browser. | Temporary storage for user data on the server. | Digital keys used for authentication and communication. |
| **Storage**         | Stored on the user's browser (client-side).               | Stored on the server.                        | Stored on the client (browser or app).        |
| **Purpose**         | Remembers user preferences and login info.                | Tracks user activity during one session.     | Confirms identity for secure communication.   |
| **Security**        | Can be exposed to attacks (XSS, CSRF) if not secured.     | Safer but requires server resources.         | Highly secure, often encrypted and tamper-proof. |
| **Lifetime**        | Can persist long-term or until cleared by the user.       | Ends when the browser or app is closed.      | Short-lived, often renewed with refresh tokens. |
| **Use Cases**       | Staying logged in, saving cart items.                     | Temporary access for authenticated users.    | Secure API communication and modern logins.   |

**Understanding the Basics**

1. **Cookies**: Cookies are like small notes saved in your browser by a website to remember who you are. For example, they store your login info or shopping cart. Theyâ€™re useful but can be targeted by hackers if not handled securely.

2. **Sessions**: Sessions work like a temporary locker system on the server. When you log in, the server sets aside a locker to store your details. This locker is tied to your session and disappears when you log out or close the browser.

3. **Tokens**: Tokens are digital passes that prove your identity securely. They are encrypted and used in modern apps or APIs for authentication. They expire quickly but can be renewed with refresh tokens to maintain access.
