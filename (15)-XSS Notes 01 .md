### XSS Basics
- **What is XSS?**
  - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into webpages viewed by other users. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other harmful effects on the user’s browser.

### How to Detect XSS?
- **How to Detect?**
  - To detect XSS, you can test input fields on a website. For example, if you enter the code `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a comment box or any input field and an alert pops up, it indicates that the site is vulnerable to XSS. The code executed successfully, showing that the application does not properly sanitize user inputs.

### View Page Source
- **Open "View Page Source":**
  - You can right-click on the webpage and select "View Page Source" to see the HTML code behind the page. This helps you verify if your input was stored or reflected in the HTML. Look for your input to see if it appears as you typed it.

### Check Input Values
- **Check Input Values:**
  - After submitting potentially harmful code, check the source code of the page again. If you see your code displayed exactly as you entered it (like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), it means the application is vulnerable. If it is encoded (like `&lt;script&gt;`), it indicates some level of protection is in place.

### Escaping
- **Escaping:**
  - Escaping refers to the process of converting characters in a user input to a safe format that does not get executed as code. If your input gets transformed into `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;`, the site is doing some escaping to prevent the execution of the script, which is a good security measure.

### Types of XSS
- **Types of XSS:**
  - **Stored XSS**: This occurs when the malicious code is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users who access the infected page later. For example, a comment containing XSS might be stored and displayed to other users.
  
  - **Reflected XSS**: This happens when the malicious script is reflected off a web server immediately. For example, if a URL includes the XSS payload and the server reflects it back in the response without proper validation.

  - **DOM-based XSS**: This is a type of XSS that happens when the client-side scripts of the web application modify the DOM (Document Object Model) in an unsafe way. Here, the attack can happen entirely in the browser without needing to go through the server.

### Testing Tools
- **Testing Tools:**
  - Use tools like **Burp Suite** and **OWASP ZAP** to find and exploit XSS vulnerabilities. These tools can automate the process of sending various payloads to input fields and analyzing the responses to check for vulnerabilities.

### HTML5 Security
- **HTML5 Security Site**: 
  - [html5sec.org](https://html5sec.org/) is a valuable resource for understanding security vulnerabilities related to HTML5. It provides detailed explanations of various vulnerabilities, including XSS, and offers solutions and best practices to improve web application security.

### Test Payloads
- **Test Payloads:**
  - You can experiment with different payloads to see how the application responds. For example:
    ```html
    <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
    ```
  - This payload attempts to execute JavaScript when an error occurs while loading an image. It’s another way to check for vulnerabilities.

### Summary
- **Summary**: XSS can be a serious security threat. Always test input fields carefully to observe how they handle potentially malicious code. If you find that your code is executed or displayed without proper sanitization, then there is a security issue that needs to be addressed.
