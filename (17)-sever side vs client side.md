| **Aspect**              | **Client-Side**                                     | **Server-Side**                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Operations performed in the user's web browser.     | Operations executed on the web server.            |
| **Key Functions**       | - User interface (UI) management<br>- Dynamic content updates<br>- Client-side validation | - Data processing and storage<br>- Business logic execution<br>- Server-side rendering of pages |
| **Technologies**        | - HTML<br>- CSS<br>- JavaScript (including frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js) | - Server-side languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Java, Ruby)<br>- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)<br>- Server frameworks (e.g., Express, Django, Flask) |
| **Execution Environment** | Runs in the user’s browser, affected by browser type and version. | Runs on the server, independent of user environment. |
| **User Interaction**    | Directly responds to user actions and provides immediate feedback. | Processes requests from users, often requiring a round trip for responses. |
| **Performance**         | Fast interactions since they don’t require server communication for every action. | May experience latency due to server processing and network delay. |
| **Security**            | Exposed to the client; vulnerabilities like XSS can occur. | More secure as sensitive operations are handled on the server; mitigates risks like SQL injection. |
| **Storage**             | Typically does not store sensitive data; uses local storage or cookies for state. | Manages and stores all sensitive data and application state in databases. |
| **Common Vulnerabilities** | - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)<br>- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)<br>- Clickjacking | - SQL Injection<br>- RCE (Remote Code Execution)<br>- Misconfigured servers |
| **Development Focus**   | Focuses on design, usability, and client-side performance. | Focuses on data integrity, security, and server performance. |
| **Examples**            | - Form validation and instant feedback<br>- Single-page applications (SPAs) | - User authentication<br>- Processing payment transactions<br>- API endpoints for data retrieval |
